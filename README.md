Hex-Pave
-
Hex-pave is a puzzle invented by Carl Hoff. The goal is to arrange all of the tiles flat in the hexagonal tray.

My implementation is a WIP. It need the following improvements:
  - Currently there's no collision detection and tiles can go on top of / beneath each other
  - The tiles are rendered in the order of their creation. This means that the tiles that are created earlier may stay behind the ones created later.
  - No solution detection. The player should check the solution for himself/herself.
